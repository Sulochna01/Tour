<h1> Animals In Korea</h1> 
<p>1. South Korea is a small country located in East Asia.</p>
<p>2. Approximately 70% of the country is covered by hills and mountains, including the three largest ranges of Taebaek, Sobaek, and Jiri Massif. The remaining landmass is covered by grassland, wetland, and forest biomes.</p>
<p>3. Once farmland, the region between South and North Korea (DMZ) has remained untouched since the end of hostilities and has reverted to an almost pristine state to create a refuge for wildlife.</p>
<p>4. In addition to forests, the area includes wetlands and estuaries frequented by migratory birds.</p>
<p>5. Hundreds of bird species enjoy the sanctuary â€“ among them several endangered cranes.</p>
<p>6. Asiatic black bears, lynxes, and other mammals also inhabit the region.</p>

  <h3>Linux</h3>
  <p>Lynx
    Lynx are solitary cats covered with beautiful, thick fur that keeps them warm 
    during frosty winters. Their large paws are also furry and contact the ground with a spreading 
    toe motion that enables them to function as natural snowshoes. Haunting montane forests in the Korean DMZ, these stealthy cats avoid 
    humans and hunt at night, so are rarely seen.</p>

<h3>Common minke whale</h3>
<p>The common minke whale is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales, 
  widely distributed from the equator to the polar regions. The population of common minke whales in Korean waters, such as the East Sea, has diminished greatly over the past
   decade due to illegal hunting, which is itself fueled by high prices paid by local restaurants for the meat. The South Korean coastguard has, however, increased its
    efforts to crack down on illegal hunting and coast guard officials have
  been catching more and more poachers involved in the hunts.</p>

<h3>Red-crowned crane</h3>
<p>1. The red-crowned crane, also known as the Japanese crane or the Manchurian crane, is a species of crane found around the Imjin River in South Korea, but also in the neighboring countries of Japan, North Korea, Russia, and China.
 <br>
 2. This crane is pretty big, with an average height of 1.5 m / 5 ft, and it does not have any natural predators within its wintering ground. However, it is considered vulnerable to extinction because of low numbers, and it has been designated a natural monument and a first-class endangered species in South Korea. 
</p>

 <h3>Asian black bear</h3>
 <p>
  1. The Asian black bear, also known as the white-chested bear, the Asiatic black bear, or the moon bear, is a medium-sized species of bear native to Asia. It can be found in Iran, the Himalayas, the Indian subcontinent, the Korean Peninsula, the Russian Far East, China, Japan, and Taiwan.
<br>
2. This bear is seriously endangered by deforestation and poaching for its body parts, used in traditional medicine. Its population in South Korea is small, and the country is one of two to allow bear bile farming legally.
