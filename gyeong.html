  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gyeongbokgung Palace, located north of Gwanghwamun Square, is one of the most iconic sights in all of Korea.Construction on Gyeongbokgung Palace was completed in 1395 at the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty during the reign of King Taejo. Gyeongbokgung, which means “palace greatly blessed by Heaven,” was built in the heart of Seoul surrounded by Mount Bugaksan and Mount Namsan.</li><br>
 <li>Expanded over time, Gyeongbokgung was the center of power during the Joseon Dynasty until the Japanese invasion of 1592-1598. During this time, the palace was destroyed by fire and left in ashes. One fire was started by slaves trying to destroy legal status records.</li><br>
 <li>In 1868, Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt and restored as an icon of Korea with help from Heungseon Daewongun, also known as Prince Regent. Over 330 buildings were constructed in the area such as Gwanghwamun Gate,Heungnyemun Gate, etc. </li><br>
 <li>With the war long over, the government of Korea has been trying to restore it to its former glory. Such steps have been taken such as restoring Gwanghwamun Gate and Heungnyemun Gate to their original state.</li><br>
